# DSG Mushroom Classifier

## Description :-

> A machine learning model which predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or not.

## Machine Learning Algorithms used :-

* Random Forest

## Python Libraries used :-

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Brief overview of my approach :-

1. At the beginning I checked for null values and low variance features

2. After that I plotted graphs amongst feature and mushroom class.

3. From those graphs I learned that tree based algorithms are better for this dataset.

4. After that I used One Hot encoding and Standard Scaler for preprocessing the dataset for different classifier

5. Then I used various tree based algorithms to see their accuracy

6. Amongst those Random Forest gave the best accuracy so I selected it.
